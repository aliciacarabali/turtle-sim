- Terminals
	- A sort of block that allows you to launch turtles directly
	when they are next to it
	
- Transmitter
	- A block that can launch all turtles within a certain range simoutaneously
	- probably not needed - is just terminal without code
	
- Ability to place blocks
	- Just single-colored blocks
- Ability to "paint" said blocks

- A new objects system
	- since robots/turtles aren't the only thing in here anymore
